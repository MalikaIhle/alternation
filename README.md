# Andrew's project
Codes etc for alternation project work


# Alternation.R
This code first calculates the alternation rate for each of the nestboxes.
Then looks at repeatability of alternation for age 6 and age 10.

# Alternation_predictors.R
This code looks at predictors of alternation, using mixed models. Based on effects used in Bebbington & Hatchwell LTT paper,
but I'm not 100% sure if what I've done is right

# Alt3_pair_duration.R
Looking at how alternation rate changes as the number of broods a pair has increases


#Extras
 #Testings.R
  Used for trial and error/experimenting before copying across to other scripts

 #Alt3 pair duration.R and Alternation predictors.R
  Neither used anymore as RStudio wouldn't commit when there's a space in filename
  
 #AJ_BroodsPerPair.csv
  CSV file of my database query
  
 #Mixed_Models_RCourse_Example.R
  I wrote this script in the R course, put here as a tutorial/personal reminder of how to do mixed models.
